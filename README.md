A fast, offline-first music player for **openly-licensed** recordings. No account, no ads,
no subscription, and no dependency on any service that geo-blocks by country.

It is a plain static web app — HTML, CSS and ES modules, with **zero build step and zero
third-party dependencies**. Serve the folder and it runs.

## Why it works where other apps don't

Streaming apps usually break in sanctioned or heavily-filtered regions for reasons that have
nothing to do with audio: the app store won't serve the install, the SDK phones home to a
blocked host, the payment provider refuses the country, or a CDN returns 403 by IP. Void Music
avoids that class of failure by construction:

| Usual dependency | What this app does instead |
| --- | --- |
| App-store distribution | Installs straight from the browser as a PWA — no store account |
| Google Play Services / Firebase | None. No analytics, no push, no remote config |
| CDN-hosted fonts, CSS, JS | Everything is local and same-origin; nothing is fetched from a third party |
| Login / payment provider | No accounts and no payments exist |
| A single API host | One host by default, plus a user-configurable mirror list raced in parallel |

The only outbound host is `archive.org`. If that is blocked on your network, add your own
mirror or reverse proxy under **Settings → Connection** and every request follows it.

### Built for a bad connection, not just a blocked one

- **Timeouts on every request** — a hung socket fails in seconds instead of spinning forever.
- **Exponential backoff with jitter** on retryable failures; 4xx responses fail fast.
- **Mirror racing** — the same request goes to several hosts at once and the first answer wins,
  so you pay the latency of the *fastest* route rather than the slowest.
- **Per-track source failover** — each track carries several URLs (two Archive datanodes plus
  the main host). A dead node costs one failed request, not a dead track.
- **Stale-while-revalidate caching** of metadata in the service worker: a flaky link shows you
  yesterday's data instead of an error page.
- **Pre-buffering** of the next track so transitions don't stall.
- **A diagnostics log** in Settings showing every retry and failure, so you can tell whether a
  problem is the app, your connection, or a block upstream.

## Where the music comes from

Everything streams from the Internet Archive's open audio collections:

- **Netlabels** — Creative Commons electronic, ambient and indie releases
- **Live Concerts (etree)** — live recordings that the artists explicitly allow to be traded
- **78 RPM Archive** — digitised 78s: jazz, blues and early pop, in the public domain
- **Classical**, **Field Recordings**, and the Archive-wide **Open Music** pool

There are no ads and no subscription because **this material is free to share** — not because a
paywall was bypassed. Commercial catalogues (the Spotify/Apple/YouTube Music kind) are
deliberately absent: streaming those requires a licence, and stream-ripping them is both illegal
and something this project won't do. If you want your own commercial library here, import the
files you already own — see below.

## Features

**Playback** — queue with shuffle and repeat, seek, volume, Media Session integration so
lock-screen and headset buttons work on Android, and an adjustable **crossfade** (0–12s under
Settings → Playback). The player runs two audio decks: one is audible while the other holds
what plays next, which is what makes the fade possible and makes plain "next" near-gapless
even with crossfade off.

**Queue** — open it from the now-playing screen to reorder tracks, drop ones you don't want,
or jump straight to anything further down.

**Library** — playlists, liked songs, and offline saves, all stored locally in IndexedDB.

**Offline** — save any track to the device and it plays with the network switched off entirely.
The app shell itself is cached by the service worker, so it launches offline too.

**Import your own files** — under **Library → Imported**, point the app at a whole folder (or
drag one in) and everything inside comes at once. Titles, artists, albums, track numbers and
embedded cover art are read out of the files themselves: ID3v2 for MP3, Vorbis comments for
FLAC and Ogg/Opus, iTunes atoms for MP4, and the filename for anything untagged. Files never
leave the device; there is no server to upload them to.

**Your YouTube playlists** — connect your account under Settings → Accounts & Sync and your own
playlists and liked videos are listed in the app. Open one and it becomes a mix: the titles and
the order come from YouTube's own API, and each song is then found in your imported files or the
open catalogue. No audio is taken from YouTube — the API does not offer it and the app does not
go around that. In the Android app connecting is one tap and nothing else: Android shows the
Google accounts already on the phone, you pick one, and Google itself asks whether Void Music may
see your YouTube library. Nothing to register, nothing to paste, and the grant is held by the
account manager, so it stays connected.

Google can decline to broker that for an app it does not recognise. When it does, the card says so
and opens a folded-away advanced setup: the full OAuth flow with a Google client ID you register
once. No credential is compiled into the app, because anything shipped inside GPL software is
public. Either way the wrapper holds the tokens and renews them, so the refresh token never enters
the page. In a plain browser, where nothing can catch the redirect back from Google, a pasted
access token still works.

**Mixes** — share a playlist as a short code or a small file. What travels is the running
order, not the audio: titles, artists, the sequence you chose. Whoever opens it resolves each
song against *their* files and the open catalogue, so two people with different libraries hear
the same running order from different sources. Nothing is uploaded, there is no server, and
there is no account to be refused. A plain `Artist - Title` list, an `.m3u`, or a playlist CSV
imports just as well.

**Lyrics** — synced, line by line, from LRCLIB where they exist.

**Sleep timer** — 5 to 60 minutes or "end of this track", with a fade rather than a hard stop.

**Listening history** — optional scrobbling to [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org): paste
a user token under Settings. Listens that can't be sent are kept and submitted when the
connection returns.

**Appearance** — dark, light or follow-the-system, plus a true-black AMOLED mode.

**Demo mode** — the *Offline Sessions* album is six short instrumentals **synthesised in your
browser with Web Audio** the moment you press play. Nothing is downloaded, so it works with no
connection at all — useful for checking that playback and offline saving behave on your setup
before you trust the network path.

**Keyboard** — `space` play/pause · `←`/`→` seek · `shift+←`/`→` prev/next · `↑`/`↓` volume ·
`m` mute · `s` shuffle · `r` repeat · `/` focus search.

## Running it

Any static file server works. It must be served over `http://` or `https://` — not `file://` —
because service workers and ES modules require an origin.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Deploying is just uploading the folder. It works on any static host, or on a small VPS with
nginx — which is the better option if you want a deployment that no third party can pull.

## The Android app

`android/` is a native APK wrapper. The whole web app is **bundled inside the APK**, so it
installs and runs with no server anywhere and works offline from the first launch.

### Getting the APK

**From CI (no toolchain needed).** Every push builds one. Open the repo's **Actions → Build
APK** run and download the `void-music-apk` artifact. Tagging a commit `v1.0.0` also attaches
the APK to a GitHub Release.

**Locally**, with the Android SDK installed:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Copy the `.apk` to the phone and open it (Android will ask you to allow installing from that
source). Debug builds are signed with the standard debug key, which is what makes them
installable with no setup. To ship signed release builds, set the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` repository secrets
and push a `v*` tag.

### Why a WebView wrapper and not a TWA

Bubblewrap-style Trusted Web Activities need the site hosted on HTTPS, a Digital Asset Links
file served from that domain, and Chrome present on the device — a chain of dependencies that
fails in exactly the conditions this project targets. This wrapper bundles the assets instead
and serves them through `WebViewAssetLoader` over `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/`.

That origin detail is the important part: loading from `file://` would put the app on an opaque
origin where IndexedDB is unreliable and service workers refuse to register. Served this way the
packaged app is an ordinary secure origin, so playlists, offline audio and the rest behave
exactly as they do in a browser — with no server involved at all.

### What the native layer adds

- **Background playback.** A `mediaPlayback` foreground service keeps audio running when the
  app is backgrounded or the screen is off, with the notification Android requires in exchange.
  The audio still belongs to the WebView — there is no second player — the web app just tells
  the service when something is playing via `window.VoidNative`.
- **File and folder import.** The system file picker is wired to the web app's import control.
  A WebView has no equivalent of `<input webkitdirectory>`, so picking a *folder* goes through
  the Storage Access Framework instead: the user grants one directory, the app walks it, and
  the page reads each file back over its own origin (`/localfile/<id>`) rather than having the
  bytes shovelled across the JavaScript bridge.
- **Back button** maps to the app's own history.
- **External links** (an item's "Source" button) open in the browser rather than inside the app.

### Notes

- The APK is HTTPS-only (`usesCleartextTraffic="false"`). A self-hosted mirror configured under
  Settings must therefore be `https://` — a plain `http://` mirror works in a desktop browser
  but is blocked inside the app.
- `minSdk` is 24 (Android 7.0). Playback quality depends on the system WebView version.
- The web app is **not** duplicated into `android/`. A Gradle `Sync` task copies it from the
  repo root at build time, so `index.html` and friends stay the single source of truth for both
  the hosted PWA and the APK; CI fails the build if that copy comes out empty.

### Installing as a PWA instead

You don't need the APK. Open the site in Chrome and choose **Install app** / **Add to Home
screen** — you get an icon and a full-screen window **without the Play Store**, which matters
because Play is exactly the piece that's unavailable in a lot of the places this app is meant to
work. The APK mainly buys you background playback and a file you can pass around directly.

## Notes and limits

- Saving a track for offline use needs a CORS-readable response from the mirror. Playback
  itself does not, so a host with strict CORS can still stream — the save will just report a
  failure it can't work around.
- Cover art is looked up from the item itself, then iTunes, then MusicBrainz and the Cover Art
  Archive. Art that was never published anywhere cannot be fetched, and those tracks keep a
  generated tile. Lookups are queued and cached — including misses — so a long scroll doesn't
  become hundreds of requests.
- Storage is per-browser. Clearing site data removes playlists, likes and offline audio; the
  app asks for persistent storage to reduce the chance of eviction under pressure.

## Licence

The application code is **GPL-3.0-or-later** — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). In short: you may use,
study, change and redistribute it, and anything you distribute that is built from it must be
free software under the same licence, with its source available.

The recordings it plays are **not** covered by that — each carries its own licence (public
domain, Creative Commons, or a trading policy set by the artist), shown on the item page and
linked back to its Archive source.
